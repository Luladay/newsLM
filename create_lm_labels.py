'''
this file aims to create a matrix to store the labels for the language model.
Each row of this matrix will contain a 1 at the index of the number stored in
the vocab_dict map. Each row represents the true label of each successive word

thus for our short news articles that have 100 words, the labels matrix will
have 100 rows and size(vocab_dict) columns

this is needed to calculate the loss in the language model LSTM
